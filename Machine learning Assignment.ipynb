    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "Here’s a brief timeline of the past six decades of how AI evolved from its inception.\n",
    "\n",
    "1956 - John McCarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ and had the first AI conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "1969 - Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs. just a list of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1997 - Supercomputer ‘Deep Blue’ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match. It was a massive milestone by IBM to create this large computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2002 - The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. \n",
    "\n",
    "2005 - 2019 - Today, we have speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes, and other innovations make their debut.\n",
    "\n",
    "2020 - Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than other methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weak AI vs. Strong AI\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing artificial intelligence (AI), it is common to distinguish between two broad categories: weak AI and strong AI. Let's explore the characteristics of each type:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak AI (Narrow AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak AI refers to AI systems that are designed to perform specific tasks and are limited to those tasks only. These AI systems excel at their designated functions but lack general intelligence. Examples of weak AI include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation algorithms, and image recognition systems. Weak AI operates within predefined boundaries and cannot generalize beyond their specialized domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong AI (General AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong AI, also known as general AI, refers to AI systems that possess human-level intelligence or even surpass human intelligence across a wide range of tasks. Strong AI would be capable of understanding, reasoning, learning, and applying knowledge to solve complex problems in a manner similar to human cognition. However, the development of strong AI is still largely theoretical and has not been achieved to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Artificial Intelligence \n",
    "Below are the various types of AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Purely Reactive\n",
    "\n",
    "These machines do not have any memory or data to work with, specializing in just one field of work. For example, in a chess game, the machine observes the moves and makes the best possible decision to win. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Limited Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "These machines collect previous data and continue adding it to their memory. They have enough memory or experience to make proper decisions, but memory is minimal. For example, this machine can suggest a restaurant based on the location data that has been gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Theory of Mind\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of AI can understand thoughts and emotions, as well as interact socially. However, a machine based on this type is yet to be built. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Self-Aware\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-aware machines are the future generation of these new technologies. They will be intelligent, sentient, and conscious.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.Machine Learning :- \n",
    "\n",
    "-->Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It has become an increasingly popular topic in recent years due to the many practical applications it has in a variety of industries. In this blog, we will explore the basics of machine learning, delve into more advanced topics, and discuss how it is being used to solve real-world problems. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn about machine learning or an experienced data scientist seeking to stay up-to-date on the latest developments, we hope you will find something of interest here.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to enable computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It is predicated on the notion that computers can learn from data, spot patterns, and make judgments with little assistance from humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It is the study of making machines more human-like in their behavior and decisions by giving them the ability to learn and develop their own programs. This is done with minimum human intervention, i.e., no explicit programming. The learning process is automated and improved based on the experiences of the machines throughout the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Good quality data is fed to the machines, and different algorithms are used to build ML models to train the machines on this data. The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data at hand and the type of activity that needs to be automated. \n",
    "\n",
    "-->Now you may wonder, how is it different from traditional programming? Well, in traditional programming, we would feed the input data and a well-written and tested program into a machine to generate output. When it comes to machine learning, input data, along with the output, is fed into the machine during the learning phase, and it works out a program for itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of problems. It allows computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. This makes it possible to build systems that can automatically improve their performance over time by learning from their experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why learning machine learning is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Machine learning is widely used in many industries, including healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. By learning machine learning, you can open up a wide range of career opportunities in these fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Machine learning can be used to build intelligent systems that can make decisions and predictions based on data. This can help organizations make better decisions, improve their operations, and create new products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Machine learning is an important tool for data analysis and visualization. It allows you to extract insights and patterns from large datasets, which can be used to understand complex systems and make informed decisions.\n",

    "-->Machine learning is a rapidly growing field with many exciting developments and research opportunities. By learning machine learning, you can stay up-to-date with the latest research and developments in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.Deep Learning:-\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Deep learning is based on the branch of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. Since neural networks imitate the human brain and so deep learning will do. In deep learning, nothing is programmed explicitly. Basically, it is a machine learning class that makes use of numerous nonlinear processing units so as to perform feature extraction as well as transformation. The output from each preceding layer is taken as input by each one of the successive layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Deep learning models are capable enough to focus on the accurate features themselves by requiring a little guidance from the programmer and are very helpful in solving out the problem of dimensionality. Deep learning algorithms are used, especially when we have a huge no of inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Since deep learning has been evolved by the machine learning, which itself is a subset of artificial intelligence and as the idea behind the artificial intelligence is to mimic the human behavior, so same is \"the idea of deep learning to build such algorithm that can mimic the brain\".\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Deep learning is implemented with the help of Neural Networks, and the idea behind the motivation of Neural Network is the biological neurons, which is nothing but a brain cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning vs. machine learning:-\n",
    "\n",
    "If deep learning is a subset of machine learning, how do they differ? Deep learning distinguishes itself from classical machine learning by the type of data that it works with and the methods in which it learns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms leverage structured, labeled data to make predictions—meaning that specific features are defined from the input data for the model and organized into tables. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it doesn’t use unstructured data; it just means that if it does, it generally goes through some pre-processing to organize it into a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning eliminates some of data pre-processing that is typically involved with machine learning. These algorithms can ingest and process unstructured data, like text and images, and it automates feature extraction, removing some of the dependency on human experts. For example, let’s say that we had a set of photos of different pets, and we wanted to categorize by “cat”, “dog”, “hamster”, et cetera. Deep learning algorithms can determine which features (e.g. ears) are most important to distinguish each animal from another. In machine learning, this hierarchy of features is established manually by a human expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, through the processes of gradient descent and backpropagation, the deep learning algorithm adjusts and fits itself for accuracy, allowing it to make predictions about a new photo of an animal with increased precision.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning and deep learning models are capable of different types of learning as well, which are usually categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning utilizes labeled datasets to categorize or make predictions; this requires some kind of human intervention to label input data correctly. In contrast, unsupervised learning doesn’t require labeled datasets, and instead, it detects patterns in the data, clustering them by any distinguishing characteristics. Reinforcement learning is a process in which a model learns to become more accurate for performing an action in an environment based on feedback in order to maximize the reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a deeper dive on the nuanced differences between the different technologies, see \"AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: What’s the Difference?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For a closer look at the specific differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, see \"Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: What's the Difference?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How deep learning works\n",
    "Deep learning neural networks, or artificial neural networks, attempts to mimic the human brain through a combination of data inputs, weights, and bias. These elements work together to accurately recognize, classify, and describe objects within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep neural networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, each building upon the previous layer to refine and optimize the prediction or categorization. This progression of computations through the network is called forward propagation. The input and output layers of a deep neural network are called visible layers. The input layer is where the deep learning model ingests the data for processing, and the output layer is where the final prediction or classification is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another process called backpropagation uses algorithms, like gradient descent, to calculate errors in predictions and then adjusts the weights and biases of the function by moving backwards through the layers in an effort to train the model. Together, forward propagation and backpropagation allow a neural network to make predictions and correct for any errors accordingly. Over time, the algorithm becomes gradually more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above describes the simplest type of deep neural network in the simplest terms. However, deep learning algorithms are incredibly complex, and there are different types of neural networks to address specific problems or datasets. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), used primarily in computer vision and image classification applications, can detect features and patterns within an image, enabling tasks, like object detection or recognition. In 2015, a CNN bested a human in an object recognition challenge for the first time.\n",
    "Recurrent neural network (RNNs) are typically used in natural language and speech recognition applications as it leverages sequential or times series data."

    "Now, after training, we test our model using the test set, and the task of the model is to identify the shape.\n",
    "\n",

    "-->In a supervised learning model, the algorithm learns on a labeled dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data. An unsupervised model, in contrast, provides unlabeled data that the algorithm tries to make sense of by extracting features and patterns on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Semi-supervised learning takes a middle ground. It uses a small amount of labeled data bolstering a larger set of unlabeled data. And reinforcement learning trains an algorithm with a reward system, providing feedback when an artificial intelligence agent performs the best action in a particular situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Supervised learning takes fully labelled dataset means each example in the training dataset is tagged with the answer the algorithm should come up with on its own. So, a labeled dataset of flower images would tell the model which photos were of roses, daisies and daffodils. When shown a new image, the model compares it to the training examples to predict the correct label.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->There are two main areas where supervised learning is useful: classification problems and regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A classification algorithm can tell the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Classification problems ask the algorithm to predict a discrete value, identifying the input data as the member of a particular class, or group. In a training dataset of animal images, that would mean each photo was pre-labeled as cat, koala or turtle. The algorithm is then evaluated by how accurately it can correctly classify new images of other koalas and turtles.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->On the other hand, regression problems look at continuous data. One use case, linear regression, should sound familiar from algebra class: given a particular x value, what’s the expected value of the y variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Clean, perfectly labeled datasets aren’t easy to come by. And sometimes, researchers are asking the algorithm questions they don’t know the answer to. That’s where unsupervised learning comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, a deep learning model is handed a dataset without explicit instructions on what to do with it. The training dataset is a collection of examples without a specific desired outcome or correct answer. The neural network then attempts to automatically find structure in the data by extracting useful features and analyzing its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the problem at hand, the unsupervised learning model can organize the data in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Clustering: Without being an expert ornithologist, it’s possible to look at a collection of bird photos and separate them roughly by species, relying on cues like feather color, size or beak shape. That’s how the most common application for unsupervised learning, clustering, works: the deep learning model looks for training data that are similar to each other and groups them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Anomaly detection: Banks detect fraudulent transactions by looking for unusual patterns in customer’s purchasing behavior. For instance, if the same credit card is used in California and Denmark within the same day, that’s cause for suspicion. Similarly, unsupervised learning can be used to flag outliers in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Association: Fill an online shopping cart with diapers, applesauce and sippy cups and the site just may recommend that you add a bib and a baby monitor to your order. This is an example of association, where certain features of a data sample correlate with other features. By looking at a couple key attributes of a data point, an unsupervised learning model can predict the other attributes with which they’re commonly associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Autoencoders: Autoencoders take input data, compress it into a code, then try to recreate the input data from that summarized code. It’s like starting with Moby Dick, creating a SparkNotes version and then trying to rewrite the original story using only SparkNotes for reference. While a neat deep learning trick, there are fewer real-world cases where a simple autocoder is useful. But add a layer of complexity and the possibilities multiply: by using both noisy and clean versions of an image during training, autoencoders can remove noise from visual data like images, video or medical scans to improve picture quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is no “ground truth” element to the data, it’s difficult to measure the accuracy of an algorithm trained with unsupervised learning. But there are many research areas where labeled data is elusive, or too expensive, to get. In these cases, giving the deep learning model free rein to find patterns of its own can produce high-quality results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Semi-supervised learning is, for the most part, just what it sounds like: a training dataset with both labeled and unlabeled data. This method is particularly useful when extracting relevant features from the data is difficult, and labeling examples is a time-intensive task for experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Common situations for this kind of learning are medical images like CT scans or MRIs. A trained radiologist can go through and label a small subset of scans for tumors or diseases. It would be too time-intensive and costly to manually label all the scans — but the deep learning network can still benefit from the small proportion of labeled data and improve its accuracy compared to a fully unsupervised model.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->A popular training method that starts with a fairly small set of labeled data is using general adversarial networks, or GANs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Imagine two deep learning networks in competition, each trying to outsmart the other. That’s a GAN. One of the networks, called the generator, tries to create new data points that mimic the training data. The other network, the discriminator, pulls in these newly generated data and evaluates whether they are part of the training data or fakes. The networks improve in a positive feedback loop — as the discriminator gets better at separating the fakes from the originals, the generator improves its ability to create convincing fakes.\n",

    "-->When training a computer vision model, you show your model example images to learn from. In order to guide your model to convergence, your model uses a loss function to inform the model how close or far away it is from making the correct prediction. A loss function is a way of describing the \"badness\" of a model. The smaller the value of the loss function, the better the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->The model formulates a prediction function based on the loss function, mapping the pixels in the image to an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->The danger in the training process is that your model may overfit to the training set. That is, the model might learn an overly specific function that performs well on your training data, but does not generalize to images it has never seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->If your model hyper-specifies to the training set, your loss function on the training data will continue to show lower and lower values, but your loss function on the held-out validation set will eventually increase. \n",

    "Training dataset:-\n",
    "The difference between the training set and the validation set is the training set is the largest corpus of your dataset that you reserve for training your model. After training, inference on these images will be taken with a grain of salt, since the model has already had a chance to look at and memorize the correct output.\n",

    "\n",
    "Validation dataset:-\n",
    "-->The validation set is a separate section of your dataset that you will use during training to get a sense of how well your model is doing on images that are not being used in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->During training, it is common to report validation metrics continually after each training epoch such as validation mAP or validation loss. You use these metrics to get a sense of when your model has hit the best performance it can reach on your validation set. You may choose to cease training at this point, a process called \"early stopping.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "-->As you work on your model, you can continually iterate on your dataset, image augmentations, and model design to increase your model's performance on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->We recommend holding out 20% of your dataset for the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Dataset:-\n",
    "-->After all of the training experiments have concluded, you probably have gotten a sense on how your model might do on the validation set. But it is important to remember that the validation set metrics may have influenced you during the creation of the model, and in this sense you might, as a designer, overfit the new model to the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Because the validation set is heavily used in model creation, it is important to hold back a completely separate stronghold of data - the test set. You can run evaluation metrics on the test set at the very end of your project, to get a sense of how well your model will do in production.  \n",

    "-->We recommend allocating 10% of your dataset to the test set."

    "-->Anomaly is a synonym for the word ‘outlier’. Anomaly detection (or outlier detection) is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. Anomalous activities can be linked to some kind of problems or rare events such as bank fraud, medical problems, structural defects, malfunctioning equipment etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Unsupervised machine learning algorithms,learn what normal behavior is, and then apply a statistical technique to determine if a specific data point is an anomaly. A system based on this kind of anomaly detection technique is able to detect any type of anomaly, including ones which have never been seen before. \n",
    "\n",
    "-->Unsupervised Anomaly detection does not require labeled training data. These techniques are based on two assumptions, which are:-\n",
    "\n",
    "a.Most of the network connections are from normal traffic, and only a small amount of data is abnormal.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.Malicious traffic is statistically different from normal traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->On the basis of these assumptions, data clusters of similar data points that occur frequently are assumed to be normal traffic, and those data groups that are infrequent are considered abnormal or malicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Some of the common unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms are self-organizing maps (SOM), K-means, C-means, expectation-maximization meta-algorithm (EM), adaptive resonance theory (ART), and one-class support vector machines. SOM, or Self-organizing map, is a popular technique that aims to reduce the dimension of data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->Anomaly detection can effectively help in catching the fraud, discovering strange activity in large and complex Big Data sets. This can prove to be useful in areas such as banking security, natural sciences, medicine, and marketing, which are prone to malicious activities. With machine learning, an organization can intensify search and increase the effectiveness of its digital business initiatives.\n",

    "Need of Anomaly Detection\n",
    "1. Anomaly detection for application performance\n",
    "Application performance of any company can either generate or reduce workforce productivity and revenue. General or traditional approaches for monitoring the application performance allow to react to issues, but still business used to suffer, and hence it affects the user. But with the help of anomaly detection using machine learning, it is easy to identify and resolve the application performance issues before they affect the business as well as users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms can simply correlate data with corresponding application performance metrics and find out the complete knowledge of the issue. There are different industries that also employ anomaly detection techniques for their businesses, such as Telco, Adtech, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Anomaly detection for product quality\n",
    "It is not enough for product managers to trust another department for taking care of required monitoring and alerts. It is always required for product managers to be able to trust that product will work smoothly. It is because the product always needs changes, from each version release to new feature upgradation, and generates anomalies. If you don't properly monitor these anomalies, it may cause millions of revenues lost and can also affect the brand reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Anomaly detection for user experience\n",
    "If you release a faulty version, you may experience a DDoS attack, risk of usage lapses across customer experiences. So, it is required to react to such issues before they impact user experience to reduce the chances of revenue loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proactively streamlining and improving user experiences will help improve customer satisfaction in a variety of industries, including Gaming, online business, etc.\n",
    "\n",
